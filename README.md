# Horiseon-Mock-up

**Purpose**

The purppose of this work was to refactor the code to ensure more user accesibility.

I did this by changing non-semantic uses to semantic ones.
Mainly added <articles>, <sections>, <header>, & <footer> tags.
Added alt image attributes as well.
I also changed the title of the page and ensured all links were active.

In the style.css file, I added comments and renamed unclear elements & removed uneccsary elements.

**Usage**
